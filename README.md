# My-First-Blockchain-Messenger
###A messenger app that uses blockchain technology to provide a fully decentralized messaging service. One of its core missions is to tackle a common issue that everyday people face with these types of apps: the privacy dilemma.
####Nowadays there are literally dozens of messaging apps out there. Some of them claim to be secure and protected, but in practice not everything is that simple. This is due to several different reasons.Another important aspect is that most current communication tools are “closed source”, meaning that the code of these products is never published and independent researchers cannot audit it. This provides an opportunity for malicious actors to find security flaws and exploit security holes in order to steal personal information.
#####On the other hand, when your data is stored in the blockchain, it is distributed all over the world. If proper security tools such as encryption are used, it becomes almost impossible to intercept messages — actually you can intercept them, but it will be just an encrypted mess, and encryption keys are never sent over the network.
